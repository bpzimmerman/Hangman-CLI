# Hangman-CLI

### Overview

This is a node.js command line hangman style game to guess the dog breed. The application will display placeholders in place of the letters which will be replaced as the user correctly guesses letters. Only five wrong guesses are allowed.

### Before you Begin

1. In the terminal command line, go to the directory where you installed the files and type `npm install` (no quotes).  This should install the required npm packages.

### Running the app

1. In the terminal command line, go to the directory where you installed the files and type `node index.js` (no quotes).

That's It! The app will ask you questions to get the input it needs.
